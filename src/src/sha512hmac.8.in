.SH NAME
sha512hmac \- compute and check HMAC values

.SH SYNOPSIS
sha512hmac [OPTIONS] [-u | -k keyfile | -K key] [-c file [-q] | file [...] ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIsha512hmac\fP command can compute and/or verify HMAC and unkeyed
checksum values for the contents of files.  Variations such as
\fIsha384hmac\fP, \fIsha256hmac\fP,
@FIPS_MAN@and \fIsha1hmac\fP
@NON_FIPS_MAN@ \fIsha1hmac\fP, \fImd5hmac\fP, \fImd4hmac\fP, and \fImd2hmac\fP
all operate similarly
except that they use different digest algorithms.

.SH SELF-TEST
As a safety measure, the tool will always attempt to verify a previously-
computed HMAC over itself with the contents of a second file
(\fI@CHECK_PREFIX@sha512hmac.@CHECK_SUFFIX@\fP for \fIsha512hmac\fP, and a
similarly-named file for each variation) before processing any other files, and
will exit with an error if the second file either cannot be read or does not
match the computed value.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-c
Check that the HMAC values and names listed in the specified file(s) are
correct for the files which are available.  The format of the files should
match the output which the tool produces when computing the values: a
hex-encoded HMAC value and then a filename, separated by whitespace.
.TP
-q
Suppress any output when checking values.
.TP
-d \fIcfgdir\fP
Specify the configuration directory to be used by the NSS library.  The default
location is \fB@DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR@\fP.
.TP
-h \fIalgorithm\fP
Generate the HMAC value using a non-default hashing algorithm.  The default is
determined by the name used to invoke the tool (sha1hmac, sha256hmac, etc.).
If no default can be derived this way, the default setting will be
\fBsha512\fP.  Specify \fIhelp\fP or another invalid value to obtain a list of
recognized algorithms.
.TP
-u
Generate an unkeyed checksum instead of an HMAC.  The output produced by the
tool should then be comparable to that of \fIsha1sum\fP and related tools.
.TP
-k \fIfilename\fP
Use the contents of the specified file as the secret key used in computing
the HMAC values.  \fIIf no key file or text is specified, a hard-coded default
value is used.\fP  This option should \fIalways\fP be used.
.TP
-K \fItext\fP
Use the text of the argument as the secret key used in computing
the HMAC values.  \fIIf no key file or text is specified, a hard-coded default
value is used.\fP
.TP
-b
Process file contents in binary mode, marking output as such by prefixing
filenames with \fI*\fP.  This option is not expected to have any other
meaningful effect.
.TP
-t \fIbits\fP
Truncate HMAC values to a given length when computing or verifying them.
.TP
-S
Generate an HMAC over the tool itself and output it on standard out.  This is a
bootstrapping option which is not expected to be used.
.TP
-P
Attempt to pass all input files through \fIprelink -y\fP before processing
their contents.  The tool always attempts to do so when computing or performing
a self-check.

@NON_FIPS_MAN@.SH WARNING
@NON_FIPS_MAN@Calculations are not performed in a FIPS-compliant mode.
